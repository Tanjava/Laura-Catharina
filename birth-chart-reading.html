            <h3>Birth Chart Reading</h3>
            <p>This is a unique blueprint of the moment you were born. You can see it as a 'screenshot' of the sky and
                the exact positions of the planets at the time of your birth. In this reading, both your strengths and
                your challenges will emerge. It also shows how you can grow and what you need in this life. While
                interpreting this reading I look at the whole picture. I will pay attention to the personal planets: the
                sun, moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. I also look at the social planets: Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, I
                also include the generation planets: Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. I will indicate these planets in house
                (life area) and in sign and how they are connected to each other. I also pay attention to the aspects,
                these are the relationships / dialogue that the planets have with each other and actually complete the
                personal story.

                <h4>Who is this reading for?</h4>
                <p>This reading is for anyone who wants to take a deep dive into themselves. You do not need any prior
                    knowledge of astrology for this reading. It is a great tool to use during your personal growth
                    journey, because you actually get to know yourself and why you are the way you are, based on the
                    stars.</p>
                <h4 class="diff">Why astrology and this reading?</h4>
                <p>Astrology can give you new and refreshing insights that can empower you to move forward with the
                    positive things in life. You can get so much out of a birth chart: what you need emotionally, what
                    you are looking for in relationships, what your challenges are and where you get your happiness.
                    It's a detailed, insightful and perzonalized in-depth reading all about you!

                <h4>What will you receive?</h4>
                <p>You will receive a PDF file of approximately 20 pages. This will be emailed to the email address you
                    provided. This way you can save it and read it back whenever you want. If you have a question you
                    could always reach me by e-mail and ask a question afterwards.</p>

                <h4 class="diff">What info do I need for this reading?</h4>
                <p>In order to read your birth chart, I need your date of birth, your exact time of birth and your place
                    of birth.</p>
                <p class="note">*Please keep in mind that a time of birth that is exact to the minute is essential for
                    the accurate interpretation of your birth chart. I highly recommend requesting a birth certificate
                    from the municipality where you were born, since it states your exact time of birth.</p>
