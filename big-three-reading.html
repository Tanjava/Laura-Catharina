            <h3>Big Three Reading</h3>
            <p>In this reading I look at the three most important personal 'planets' and points. I will incorporate the
                sun here, which represents your ego, identity and personality. I will also incorporate the moon, which
                represents your inner world and your emotions. Lastly, I will discuss your rising sign, also called
                your ‘ascendant’. This indicates how you behave towards the outside world. It is often said that this is
                the mask you wear. I see it more as the person you are when you walk into a room with people you don't
                know.</p>

                <h4>Who is this reading for?</h4>
                <p>You do not need to have any prior knowledge of astrology for this reading.This reading is suitable
                    for anyone who wants to get acquainted with astrology, but does not want to dive deeper into it yet.
                    It can
                    tell you briefly about your character aptitude, about your strengths and weaknesses and about any
                    challenges or talents.</p>
                <h4 class="diff">Why this reading?</h4>
                <p>This reading is a nice stepping stone towards the journey of discovery to yourself. The more you
                    learn about yourself, the more you know how to deal with your own energy. I myself have experienced
                    that I can get a lot of strength from this self-knowledge, which I have been able to use in all
                    facets of my life: work, relationships, free time, etc.</p>

                <h4>What will you receive?</h4>
                <p>You will receive a PDF file of approximately 10 pages. This will be emailed to the email address you
                    provided. This way you can save it and read it back at any time when you want. If you have a
                    question you could always reach me by e-mail and ask a question afterwards.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4 class="diff">What info do I need for this reading?</h4>
                <p>In order to read your birth chart, I need your date of birth, your exact time of birth and your place
                    of birth.</p>
                <p class="note">*Please keep in mind that a time of birth that is exact to the minute is essential for
                    the accurate interpretation of your birth chart. I highly recommend requesting a birth certificate
                    from the municipality where you were born, since it states your exact time of birth.</p>
